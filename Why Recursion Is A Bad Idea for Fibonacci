It’s a bad Idea to use recursion to find the Fibonacci of a number because the time taken for computing nth Fibonacci number is exponential 
for a recursive algorithm while the time taken is linear for an iterative algorithm. Due to this exponential time, it’s expensive to use 
recursion to solve Fibonacci, both in terms of cost and time. Unless the language being used to implement the Fibonacci guarantees tail 
recursion elimination and automatic memorization, then recursion can be implemented with little or no loss in efficiency although sometimes 
this efficiency may come at the expense of readability due to the need to abstract the code to optimize efficiency hence it’s imperative that 
using recursion might not be the best idea to solve Fibonacci since Iteration exists.
